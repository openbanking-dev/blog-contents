# On-boarding your application to the bank

For the moment, you are an anonymous developer to the eco-system. As we mentioned in the previous articles, there is an Open Banking circle of trust system and basically you want to join it.
For the purpose of the learning curve, we are going to use the ForgeRock model bank and they do have an Open Banking directory dedicated.
We are going to use it to join the circle of trust for the model bank.

## Create an account
Go to https://directory.ob.forgerock.financial/ and register a new developer account.
Once login, you would see a dashboard, with your organisation and the list of your software statements.

## Edit your organisation
You can edit your organisation to reflect a bit more who you are. It's going to be used during the Open Banking flow when the user authorise the request.

## Create a software statement
A software statement is another word to say application. You can choose to have one application register and use it for everything, or you can choose to create multiples applications, up to you.
Start by clicking on `Create a new software statement`. 
You can complete the entire form but if you feel a bit lazy like me, just complete the essential:
* Name: It will displayed in the consent screen, it's nice to show a friendly name than a blank
* redirect uris: we don't want to host an app for exploring Open Banking, we are going to use google. Put https://google.com
* logo: It's also display in the consent. You can use ours for the exercise if you like. 


You will see on the top that there are a few tabs:
* General: it's the global information of your application
* Transport/Signing/Encryption keys: cryptography is fundamental for Open Banking. This is the section where you will get your tests keys.
* Software Statement Assertions (SSA): It's your financial passport if you like. It is a JSON signed (JWS) by the directory, that will attest that you are part of the circle of trust. This tab allows you to generate a new SSA on demand.
* On Boarding: the directory can onboard for you to the ForgeRock bank. Although, we kind of want how the on-boarding works so we are going to do that manually.

Cool fact: the directory also offers APIs, we will be able to do the same things we did in the UI but via the APIs. Very handy especially for generating a new SSA.
